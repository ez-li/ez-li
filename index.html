            hi, my name is eileen. i'm a lover of art, technology, and nature. i grew up watching the changing colors of
            the sky in san francisco's sunset district. and currently i work as a hybrid ux designer / engineer,
            formerly was a data analyst / scientist. however, the more interesting parts of who i am lie in my
            <a>personal practices</a> and passions. including a lifelong practice of giving healing and serving my community.
